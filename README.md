## Exploring FreeRTOS with QEMU: System API Usage and Customization

Gained proficiency in using the QEMU ISA simulator to run an embedded operating system, specifically FreeRTOS, and created a detailed tutorial for its installation and usage. I developed practical examples that utilized the main APIs of the operating system to demonstrate its functionality. Additionally, I customized FreeRTOS by implementing an aging mechanism to improve scheduling performance.
